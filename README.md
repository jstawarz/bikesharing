# Bikesharing

## Overview of Analysis

In this analysis, we are working with our friend Kate. After vactioning in New York City, Kate & I realized that CitiBike, a bikesharing business in
New York City, allowed for us to explore the city and helped make the vacation so enjoyable. Building on this, we decided that a bikeshare in
Des Moines, Iowa could make for a great business venture. After working on the idea, Kate has found a potential investor for the business.


### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize bikesharing data from New York City. The visualizations will help us better understand how the
business works in New York City. From there, we can use the visualizations to demonstrate to how a bikeshare could work in Des Moines.

## Bikesharing Analysis Results

### Who is Riding?

First and foremost, we will look at who our potential customers are. With just a simple pie chart, we can determine that men, are the dominant
user group of the bikeshare.

### How are they Riding?

Here, we generated the following tables which show how users are riding the bikes. The typical user rides the bike for a short amount of time.
Nearly all rides last less than an hour, with the mjority of rides lasting 4 to 7 minutes. The metrics for ride duration are also not greatly
impacted by gender, meaning that men and women ride the bikes for similar amounts of time.

### When are they Riding?

The following two visualizations help demonstrate when our customers are riding the most. Again, we see that although men are the dominant user
group, both men and women typically use the bikeshare the most during the weekday commuter hours. With these heatmaps, we can reasonably 
determine that commuters are using the bikes the most. The charts also give us a sense of when the bikes are not being used. Early morning hours
could offer a good opportunity to conduct repairs, exchange bikes, etc.

Lastly, the heatmap below pulls much of the previous information together. It reinforces that men are using the bikes the most, and that weekdays
are popular times for biking. However, it also shows how subscribers use the bikes most often. This could be key in running a bikeshare business
as we would want to encourage customers to purchase a subscription to the bikeshare service.

### Associated Costs

Here, we can see which bikes are being used the most. Using this data, we can begin to predict which bikes will need repairs.
This is important data as we will need to repair bikes as they are being used to ensure our bikes are in top condition. Additionally,
with the data below, we can circulate bikes into use to replace others that are under repair.

## Summary of Results

Viewing the data analyzed we can demonstrate the who, how and when of bikesharing. With the visuals, we can see that bikeshares are typically
short rides, the dominant user group is men, and the peak hours of bikesharing occur during commuting hours. Additionally, we also know that
riders who have subscriptions to the bikeshare use them the most frequently. Overall, the visualizations can provide us and out potential investors
a sense of who our target customer base is and what type of costs will be incurred to keep the business running. 

In terms of additional visualizations, we could create charts to display the breakdown of users by age. This visualization could offer more insight
into what type of customer we should market the bikeshare to. Another idea for a visualization would be to look at data from the bikeshare during the
various seasons. Charts and graphs showing ridership during the spring, fall and winter could help us better understand the seasonality of the bikeshare
business.
